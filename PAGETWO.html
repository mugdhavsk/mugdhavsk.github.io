        <h3>Hello! We are London Tours For Teens, an organisation that helps teenagers know landmarks all over London for those that would like to visit in the future.
          <h4> We provide cheap tickets for your journey and reccomend famous landmarks and areas that would be good for your photos. <h4>
    <p> So, who created this website?<p>
      <p> Mudghavsk - Team leader of Team B's website<p>
        <p> Mudhavsk is the team leader of Team B, she is positive, passionate about coding - even with no coding experience! Without her, I think we'd be a mess! Thanks to her, we have our background, logo, and more!<p>


          <p> Diana - Coder
            <p> Diana is a friendly and humble girl who never gave up when she had difficulties with her coding. Thanks to her, we have our slide show and has resized images just for us! She is a wonderful co-worker! We love her all very much!
              <p>

          <p> Rishika - coder<p>
            <p> Rishika is a shy but funny girl, who is determined to learn how to code. She has a wonderful singing voice and wont give up with her code. Although she struggles with asking for help, she is always willing to give it a shot!<p>
          <p> Chantelle - coder (thats me!)<p>
            <p> Hiya, I'm the one in charge of making different pages, assisting my team mates on code and the one who has created the draft file to help us all on what we need to focus on with our website. For the past days, I've had the honour to work with three intelligent ladies. I am so thankful to Vodafone for providing this workshop for young females interested in coding. Thank you, Vodafone.
              <p> Here at London Tours For Teens, we try our best to find the latest trending aesthetic areas in London just for you. Travelling can be made so easy, with just a click!
